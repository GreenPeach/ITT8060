  Answer the questions below.  You answers to questions 1--8 should be
  correct F# code written after the question. This file is an F#
  script file, it should be possible to load the whole file at
  once. If you can't then you have introduced a syntax error
  somewhere.

  This coursework will be graded. Please send the completed coursework
  including your name and student ID in the comments by e-mail to

// 1. Make an empty list of generic type.

// 2. Make an empty list of type 'int list' (or list<int>).

// 3. Make a three element list called 'cities' containing pairs of
// city names (string) and populations (int).

// 4. Write a function 'filterOutVillages' to filter out cities with
// less than 1000 inhabitants from your list.  It should not use the
// filter function from the library. The function should use pattern
// matching and recursion.

// 5. Test the function 'filterOutVillages' on your list 'cities'.

// 6. Calculuate the average population of your list of cities. The
// function should use pattern matching and recursion.

// 7. Write function 'allcaps' which capitalizes the names of cities in a
// list of cities. Hint: "abc".ToUpper ()

// 8. Write a function that first filters out villages and then
// capitalizes names. Use the operation '|>' in your answer.

// 9. Convert 'cities' into a pair of a list of city names and a list
// of city populations. Use a function that you saw in lecture 2.

// 10. Create a list of pairs of lower case ascii characters (a-z) and
//     their ascii codes.  e.g. for the letter 'a' the pair would be ('a',97)
//     Hint: you can use a function you saw in lecture 2 to help.
