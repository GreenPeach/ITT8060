// 1. Download a snapshot of the RSS feed (or load directly over HTTP):
//    http://www.theregister.co.uk/headlines.atom
//    Using the example from live6.fsx, write a data structure RSSPart in F#
//    that you would use to represent RSS feeds.


// 2. Write a function that loads the (downloaded) XML file and parses it into
//    the data structure designed in task 1.


// 3. Write an aggregate function that returns how many news items each author 
//    wrote on a particular day.


// 4. Define a list of 5 functions where each function tests if a word of interest
//    is contained in the summary field.
//    Use key words of your interest (i.e. at least 5 key words).

// 5. Write a function that filters out entries of interest based on the list defined
//    in the previous problem.

// 6. ** Bonus **
//    Define a decision tree based on the key words of interest. For example, if the
//    word "space" is found in the summary, the entry is of interest if it also contains
//    the word "software".
